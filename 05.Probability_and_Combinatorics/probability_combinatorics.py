1. Probability
- Experiment - initial conditions - > outcome
- Random event - A set of outcomes of an experiment which happens with a certain probability
- Random variable - the value outcome of the experiment
- It is not possible to predict the next outcome of a random event, but we can perform trials(the more the better)
- Statistical definition of probability -> lim m/n , n->infinity
- The sum of all probabilities = 1 (100% of event happening)

2. Combinatorics
- Counting objects and group of objects
- Finite (countable) number of outcomes
- All outcomes have equal probability
- Counting rules - Computing a combinatorial probability, desired outcomes

- Rule of sum => One of all
- Rule of product => One after the other

- Permutation - Pn -> n! - shuffling
- Variations - Permutation of subset -> n! / (n-k)!
- Combinations - n! / (n-k)! * k! - n choose k

3. Algebra of events
- Event space - the set (omega) of all possible events
- Logical relations are the same as set operations:
AND - intersection
OR - union
NOT - complement

4. Conditional probability
- Additional information about the experiment outcome can change the probabilities

5. Applications
6. Statistical distributions
- Frequency distributions (histograms)
- Discrete distributions (n count events, which are known) - Probability mass function
- Continuous distribution - Probability density function

Common distributions:
- Bernoulli and Uniform distribution
- Binomial distribution (one coin 2 times, two coins 1 time)
- Normal distribution
7. Central limit theorem
- The sum of many independent random variables tends to a normal distribution even if the original random variables
are not normally distributed OR
- The sampling distribution of the mean of any independent random variable will be normal or nearly normal if the
sample is large enough (e.g. 30-40 +)
e.g. - Customers in a shop
