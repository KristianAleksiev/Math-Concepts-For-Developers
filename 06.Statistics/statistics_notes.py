1. Descriptive and inferential statistics
Descriptive
- Summarize and describe data
- No predictions, describe what is seen
- Statistical population - all items of interest

Inferential
- In many cases the population is too large
- Population is represented by a subset (sample)
- The population characteristics can be estimated by the sample
- Random sampling e.g. voting predictions, mean salary by age

2. Population and sample

Sampling:
- Define the population
- Sampling frame - a set of items from the population
- Sampling method - rules of selection from the frame
- Sample size

Sampling methods:
- Random sampling
- Stratified sampling - categories

3. Properties of statistical distribution

Summarizing distributions: ( summary statistics )
- Histogram - complete description of the sample distribution
- Central tendency - Do the values tend to cluster around a center?
- Modes - How many clusters are there and where are they?
- Variance - How spread out is the distribution?
- Tails - How quickly do probabilities change as we move away from the center(s)?
- Outliers - Are there extreme values, far from center?

Arithmetic Mean - The sum of all measurements divided by the number of observations
Median - The middle value of the distro, sorted, less sensitive to outliers
Mode - The most frequent item, >1, multimodal distribution

Standard deviation (Variance)
- The distance between a point and the mean

Skewness (Асиметрия) +ve zero -ve - Посока на опашката
- Moment of distributions

Kurtosis (Ексцес)  <3, =3, >3, form of distribution, density in center vs density in skew, Гаусово разпределение(3)

4. Visualizing data

5. Covariance and correlation
Measure of the joint variability of two variables:
- Positive - One increases, the other increases
- Negative - One increases, the other decreases
- Zero - The two variables don't vary at all

- Covariance matrix, main diagonal
6. Common misconceptions
- Correlation vs causation

- Reverse causation - The faster the windmill rotates, the more wind there is => Windmill causes wind
- Lurking variable - The more firefighters there are to put out a fire, the greater the damage => FFs cause damage
- Bidirectional relationship - Predators affect prey, prey food, prey food affects predators
- Coincidence
